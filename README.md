# GATE-plugin-Lang_Italian
The Italian plugin contains two applications for NE recognition: one which includes the TreeTagger for POS tagging in Italian (italian+tagger.gapp) , and one which does not (italian.gapp). Simply load the application required from the plugins/Lang_Italian directory. You do not need to load the plugin itself from the GATE Developer’s Plugin Management Console. Note that the TreeTagger must ﬁrst be installed and set up correctly. Check that the runtime parameters are set correctly for your TreeTagger in your application. The applications both contain resources for tokenisation, sentence splitting, gazetteer lookup, NE recognition (via JAPE grammars) and orthographic coreference. Note that they are not intended to produce high quality results, they are simply a starting point for a developer working on Italian. Some sample texts are contained in the plugins/Lang_Italian/data directory.
